OpenJNLP Library, a component of OpenJNLP - an Open Source Java Network Launching Manager
<http://openjnlp.nanode.org/>


What is OpenJNLP?

OpenJNLP is an implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol, known as JNLP. This allows the user to launch Java applications and applets directly from the Internet without the use of a web browser. Launched apps are also managed locally by OpenJNLP, which will detect and can retrieve updates.


Status

OpenJNLP is in an early stage of development. As an open-source project we subscribe to the "release early, release often" school of thought so that we can get feedback from users and developers.

Specific details about each version of OpenJNLP can be found in the History.txt file included with this release.

Contact information and the latest release can be found at <http://openjnlp.nanode.org/> or you can email openjnlp@nanode.org.


Using the OpenJNLP Library

Information for using OpenJNLP as a standalone library or embedded within another project can be found in the Using.txt file included with this release.


Platform Support

OpenJNLP has been tested on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. The goal is to fully support any platform with Java 1.3 or newer, but our testing resources are limited. We welcome any feedback, especially for platforms for which we can not test directly.
