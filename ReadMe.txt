What is OpenJNLP?

OpenJNLP is an implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol, known as JNLP. This allows the user to launch Java applications and applets directly from the Internet without the use of a web browser. Launched apps are also managed locally by OpenJNLP, which will detect and can retrieve updates.
